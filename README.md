Within this portfolio, you will find my technical writing projects. As this portfolio expands, I will expand the information below so that you can understand my design decisions. 

## Google Earth
Within the Google Earth folder, you will find my documentation for navigating and using Google Earth. In my free time, I enjoy jumping around the globe in Google Earth and exploring remote places. However, when trying to find solutions using Google's documentation, I would often become frustrated with the lack of accompanying pictures with the directions. So, I have created my own documentation, complete with pictures and text descriptions.

### Tools
* All documents are written in VS Code using the AsciiDoc markup language. 
* The files are managed on my local machine using Git.
* All images are edited using GIMP.
* The directions are relevant for Google Earth Pro 7.3.
